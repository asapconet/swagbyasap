                We have an insane mobile app! The mobile app allows you to get
                real-time notifications when someone comments on your status,
                direct messages you, or when thereâ€™s a new video added to the
                Academy! You can also watch every video within the academy, take
                every quiz, or read every PDF straight from your mobile app.
